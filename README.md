## Project Description
Our project aims to create a user-friendly audio/video translation tool that seamlessly translates content into multiple languages. Leveraging advanced AI models and innovative techniques, we provide a streamlined solution for cross-cultural communication and understanding. With a focus on accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility, our tool empowers users to translate audio and video files with ease, catering to diverse linguistic needs.

## Tech Stack

1. **OpenAI's GPT-3 ("whisper-1" model)**:
   - Used for swift translation of audio content into English.
   - Provides specialized capabilities tailored for audio tasks, ensuring accurate transcriptions.

2. **Google Translate API (via `googletrans` library)**:
   - Integrated for text translation, converting English text into Arabic.
   - Offers a robust and reliable solution for language translation.

3. **Streamlit**:
   - Utilized for developing a user-friendly interface.
   - Enables easy file upload and selection of translation languages, enhancing user experience.

4. **Python**:
   - Primary programming language for development.
   - Offers flexibility and ease of integration with libraries and APIs.

5. **Tempfile and OS modules**:
   - Used for temporary file management and system-level operations, ensuring efficient processing of audio/video files.

6. **Proprietary Timestamp Extraction Technique**:
   - Developed internally for extracting precise timestamps from the translated text generated by the "whisper-1" model.
   - Ensures accuracy in timing information, enhancing the quality of translations.

7. **Data Structures**:
   - Employed for organizing and managing the extracted timestamps within the user interface, facilitating seamless presentation to the user.

In summary, our project combines cutting-edge AI models, reliable APIs, and innovative techniques to deliver a polished audio/video translation tool. With a focus on user experience and accuracy, we strive to bridge linguistic barriers and promote global communication and understanding.
